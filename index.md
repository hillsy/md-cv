## Currently

Working in the Platforms, Infrastructure and Live Services directorate of NHS
Digital, based in Leeds. My time is split between developing new infrastructure
and services, improving legacy services run by the Information Standards team
(usually via DevOps principles), and normal operational tasks such as third line
support.

My 2018 performance review said:

> "One of Shaun's strengths is his ability to analyse and understand the
> requirements of a problem, and to propose and deliver the effective solution,
> not necessarily just what was asked for... His ability to analyse and build the
> technologies has led to some significant improvements in the delivery and
> management of services."
